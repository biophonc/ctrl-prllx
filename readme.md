# hello ;)

__what it can do for you (in a nutshell):__

* This script does *parallaxing* with backgrounds and elements.  
* It's a jQuery UI widget. 
* Works on modern browsers.
* But does not work on iOS devices.
* You can pass a `callback` for each *parallaxing slide*.
* Uses the `data-attribute` *(because I like it)*.
* You can define a `threshold` for the `callback` (useful if you need a pagination).
* It's not perfect yet ;)


more infos coming soon ;)
